    text: `Raising Consciousness: Enhance Visibility for Pedestrians and Cyclists 

Every day in South Africa, an estimated 27 million pedestrians are on the move. With up to 40% of motor vehicle accidents involving pedestrians, the threat to their safety is alarmingly high. In response, Raising Consciousness is continuing a vital campaign initiated by the Automobile Association and Arrive Alive to raise awareness about the many pedestrians who often go unnoticed by drivers.

After witnessing two hit-and-run incidents this year, along with a close friend nearly losing their life in a similar accident, the director of Raising Consciousness has become acutely aware of the countless individuals who walk or cycle in the dark to reach their destinations—whether it be work, school, or elsewhere. Unfortunately, many of these commuters lack the reflective or light-colored clothing necessary to ensure they are seen after dark.

To address this critical issue, we have launched a campaign aimed at providing reflective sashes to pedestrians and cyclists. This initiative serves a dual purpose: to enhance the visibility of those on the roadside and to remind motorists of the numerous unseen travelers moving through the night.

We are thrilled to announce that with generous sponsorship, we have secured 1,000 high-quality reflective sashes to distribute to cyclists and pedestrians from underprivileged communities. These sashes easily slip over clothing and will be distributed at schools and taxi ranks, ensuring that those most at risk have access to this essential safety gear. Additionally, we will be providing sashes to schoolchildren commuting in the dark.

These reflective sashes are not only perfect for pedestrians and cyclists but also for joggers who exercise in low-light conditions. To sustain this impactful initiative, Raising Consciousness will sell these sashes for R50 each, with every purchase sponsoring an additional sash for someone in need.

Community members can donate and contribute to this life-saving effort through the donate button on the website.

Join us in making our roads safer and ensuring that no pedestrian or cyclist remains unseen. Together, we can save lives and enhance awareness for all!`,

    text: `Lifeskills Programmes and Substance Abuse Awareness Programmes

Puberty can be a challenging time, often resembling an emotional rollercoaster even in the most supportive families. When additional stresses—such as bullying, divorce, body image issues, home conflicts, dyslexia, eating disorders, and struggles with inclusion or exclusion—are added, it becomes even more complex. Alongside the physical changes like body hair, breasts, periods, acne, and mood swings, adolescents face a multitude of hurdles. It’s a lot to manage!

Many parents, having never learned the necessary skills, do their best with the tools they have. Our mission is to teach families and individuals to work together in a solution-focused manner, helping them create clear visions for their lives.

We empower adolescents to take ownership of their behaviors and attitudes by helping them understand their impact—not only on themselves but also on their relationships and overall life experiences. Our goal is to foster personal growth and self-acceptance.

Our groups are facilitated by skilled therapists who maintain a nurturing and supportive environment while guiding group dynamics with a gentle yet firm approach.

We employ an interactive model of awareness and skills training workshops. These sessions cover essential topics such as creating a vision and sense of identity, making informed decisions, setting boundaries, understanding bullying, distinguishing between toxic and healthy relationships, fostering effective communication, and managing emotions constructively. Most importantly, we aim to cultivate conscious, confident, happy, and independent young adults who lead purposeful lives.

We also offer workshops for parents, educators, and organizations. Our comprehensive course consists of eight weekly workshops designed to be age and gender-appropriate, equipping adolescents with the life skills needed to navigate their teen years smoothly and safely. Topics include emotional regulation, healthy boundary-setting, the pros and cons of social media, body image, self-esteem, and nurturing healthy relationships and interpersonal communication.

We encourage individuals to develop a strong sense of self and an awareness of their impact on others. Each weekly session consists of a 50-minute interactive workshop followed by a 50-minute group facilitation process, allowing participants to cultivate compassion, empathy, and mindfulness for themselves and those around them.`,

Our "Train the Trainer" program has successfully trained Xhosa-speaking facilitators at the Soetwater Environmental Centre, where we incorporate eco-awareness and emphasize the importance of recycling, alongside tackling the growing issue of litter.

Additionally, we have hosted camps specifically designed for individuals in recovery from addiction, providing them with relapse prevention tools and life skills to replace outdated thought patterns. We also facilitate camps for other organizations focused on brainstorming and structuring effective partnerships within communities.

Looking ahead, we will be implementing camps for youth to train as peer mentors, equipping them to offer invaluable support in schools.`,

    text: `Raising Consciousness delivers substance abuse awareness programmes to schools. The programme is offered to schools in previously disadvantaged commuinities at no cost to the school. We rely on funding to implement these programmes which are available in English , Afrikaans and Xhosa. Conscious School Programmes provide an understanding and awareness of substance abuse and addiction to the greater school community.  The programme provides not only information, but also, skills for learners, teachers and parents to use when dealing with drug or alcohol issues.  These skills include areas such as assertiveness and boundary setting, peer pressure reversal, healthy decision-making, dealing with negative feelings, self-confidence and goal setting.

Conscious School Programmes discourage school communities from accepting drug and alcohol use as a way of life and encourage youth to seek more healthy alternatives and lifestyles.  

The learners’ programme consists of individual sessions with each class.  These sessions can be facilitated during the life skills lessons.  The learners are taught about substance abuse and the high-risk behaviour linked to this.  Emphasis is placed on the dangers of teenage drinking.  The facts of the disease of addiction, the signs, the symptoms and the progression are also discussed.  The learners are all given a list of referrals if they, or someone they know may have a problem.  They are also given booklets with information on the different drugs and the effects.

The parents evening is an hour-and-a-half session held in the evening.  They are given the same information and advised on how to recognise, and what to do if their children have a problem.  Parents are also given booklets and referral lists.

The teachers training programme is held in the afternoon, and addresses the policy and procedures schools should implement when dealing with substance abuse issues.  This programme empowers teachers by enabling them to recognise if a learner has a substance abuse problem, and how to deal with it in a beneficial and amenable manner.

 
PROGRAMME AIMS

1.     Prevention programmes are designed to enhance “protective factors” and move toward reversing or reducing known “risk factors.”
2.    Prevention programmes address all forms of drug abuse, including the use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants. 
3.   Prevention programmes include skills to resist drugs when offered, strengthen personal commitments against drug use, and increase social competency (e.g., in communications, peer relationships, self-efficacy, and assertiveness,) in conjunction with reinforcement of attitudes against drug use. 
4.    Prevention programmes for adolescents include interactive methods, such as peer discussion groups and role- plays, rather than didactic teaching techniques alone. 
5.    Preventative programmes target the greater school community.  This includes the learners, parents and educators.  It is important that everyone share and understand the same approach, attitudes and information. 
6.    Prevention programmes for parents or caregivers.  This component reinforces what the children are learning, such as facts about drugs and their harmful effects.  This empowers parents and creates opportunities for family discussions about use of legal and illegal substances and family policies about their use. 
7.    Empirical research studies show family-focused prevention efforts have a greater impact than strategies that focus on parents only or children only.  Research is an important component of school programmes.  Raising Consciousness will collect statistics through the method of confidential questionnaires, and will use this data to continually evaluate, update and monitor programmes, as well as sharing it with organisations such as SACENDU (The South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use), and the Medical Research Council.
8. Community programmes need to strengthen norms against drug use in all drug abuse prevention settings, including the family, the school, and the community. 
9.  Prevention programmes are adapted to address the specific nature and diversities of the drug abuse problem in the different communities. 
10. The higher the level of risk of the target population, the more intensive the prevention effort must be and the earlier it must begin.`,

    text: `Creating awareness without offering a path forward can leave individuals feeling vulnerable, fragile, and helpless. In some cases, it can be more damaging than uplifting.

Recognizing that everyone faces hurdles and stresses in life—often without support or tools—we offer a range of resources to help individuals, families, and organizations access the care and support they need. Our aim is to guide people toward solutions rather than allowing them to remain stuck in their problems. We teach our community that there is no shame in acknowledging a problem; the first step to recovery is accepting help.

    text: `RAISING CONSCIOUS TEENS

These courses cater for teens from 12 yeaars old to 19 years old. The younger teens and older teens courses are designed to address issues specific to the ages and gender, thus there are girls and boys groups.

Each course set of 8 workshops running weekly in 2hr sessions for a duration of 8 weeks.
The workshops are broken up into two 40-minute sessions with a refreshment break in between.
Refreshments are provided.

The workshops in the first 40 minutes aim to empower young people to gain a strong sense of self, maintain healthy communication and interpersonal dynamics and gain skills to process and regulate emotion in a healthy way.  

In the second 40 minutes of each weekly session, we use a group therapy process to help individuals become more conscious of their own behaviours by easier recognising them mirrored in others. We teach teens to give gentle and honest feedback and assist them in receiving uncomfortable feedback without old defences or acting out or victim thinking.

The courses specifically designed to deal with age and gender appropriate issues and topics relevant to teenagers in current times.

Topics covered are
·         Creating a vision and identity
·         Dealing with feelings in a healthy manner
·         Healthy Communication and interpersonal skills
·         Inclusion vs exclusion
·         Body Image and self esteem
·         Understanding and recognising addictive behaviours, including social media,
        eating disorders, sex and love addiction and co-dependency
·         Maintaining healthy boundaries and recognising toxic behaviour
·         Peer Pressure and setting healthy boundaries
·         Making informed decisions

Parents are asked to attend the first and last week’s sessions as we feel the family needs to work together as a unit to achieve a positive and cooperative family dynamic.

Cost of the course including all course materials is R3280 and payment plans can be arranged.`,
